Welcome to my blog about Cloud Architecture and Microsoft Azure solutions.<br>
My name is Thomas Naunheim. I’m working as Cloud Architect and Engineer in Koblenz, Germany.<br>
In this job role I’m involved in various projects to design and implement cloud solutions.<br>

My subject areas are cloud-native, identity and security solutions on Microsoft Cloud platform.<br>
I am pleased to be a active part of the Azure community and speak at meetups and conferences.<br>
You'll find also an overview about my sessions (including slides) and engagements on this blog.<br><br>
This is my personal blog. Opinions are my own and possibly not the views of my employer.<br><br>
