I have been speaking about Azure AD B2C at the local “.NET User Group” in Koblenz (Germany) this week.

During the session I’ve covered several topics of Microsoft’s cloud-based customer IAM solution such as architecture, use cases and customizing of policies. Live demos and notes from the field included! You can find my slides [here](https://github.com/Cloud-Architekt/meetups/blob/master/2019-12-11%20DNUGKoblenz-Manage-and-securing-AzureAD-B2C.pdf).

Co-speaker Pascal Martin demonstrated how to easily integrate an ASP.net Core 3.0 application in B2C as “live coding” performance on this developer meetup. The code sample will be available on his [GitHub repository.](https://github.com/obivandamme?tab=repositories)

It would be a great pleasure for me to speak about Azure AD B2C at other meetups and conferences next year. If you are hosting Azure community events or conferences feel free to contact me via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/thomas_live) or mail.
