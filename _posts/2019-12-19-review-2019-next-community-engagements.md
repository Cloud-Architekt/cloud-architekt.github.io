_The year is nearly overâ€¦ now is a great time to look back and see whatâ€™s next in the upcoming year.

## Review 2019
I had the pleasure to talk at various meetups and conferences this year.
In particularly it was an exciting time to speak at three events (Bonn, Glasgow and Lingen/Ems) within four weeks.
Thanks to everyone that gives me the chance to be part of community events or attended my sessions. 

Iâ€™ve also started this blog to publish some articles about Azure and share the content from my community sessions with you. I hope to spend more time to writing blog posts next year.

Iâ€™ve also changed my job role and became part of the companyâ€™s own innovation team and worked on some new cloud solutions.
Other projects have been completed and the hard work pays off.
It is an exciting time to work in the IT. ðŸ¤“

I want to thank all my friends, colleagues, blog readers, followers and supporters.
It was an amazing year with many highlights. 

I am looking forward to the new challenges and events that coming up next yearâ€¦

## Next community engagements in 2020
In January I will speak about Azure AD Hybrid Identity Security at [Azure Meetup Thueringen](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Azure-Thueringen-Meetup/events/266891687/) (16th) and [VCNRW in Cologne](https://vcnrw.de/23-01-2020-koeln/) (23th). Other meetup talks about Azure AD B2C are already planned and Iâ€™m working on new sessions.
Several â€œCall for papers" have been submitted to conferences in Europe.

I would be delighted to share my experiences and knowledge with the community.
Feel free to contact me via Twitter or e-mail if you are hosting events such as local user groups, meetup or conferences!

I wish you all relaxing and enjoyable christmas holidays
â€¦ and all the best for 2020.

Looking forward to see you next year!

Thomas
